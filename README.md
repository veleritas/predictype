## Overview

PredicType provides biological concept annotation capabilities from within Google Docs using [BioPortal](http://bioportal.bioontology.org). Originally conceived as a real-time biological auto-complete for biological concepts, PredicType was retooled into an annotation tool due to limitations in the Google Docs API.
